This is where we will explain how to run this project from the git side
this will never be read by someone who accesses are website
right now it is setup in such a way as to only launch to a local host from
your computer this is beacuse I don't know how to do it anyother way

Anyway... right now to set up and run the program you need to 

git clone 

bash ./setup_linux.sh

then if you want to run the website

run.sh
